Install procedure requires Cmake (http://www.cmake.org)
Once obtained, run the following from this directory:
	$ cmake .
	$ make
	# make install		##Optional -- can just use 'ncrok' exec
The program can then be run as 'ncrok'

Plan B:
run ./build. It won't check any dependencies. Crappy.

Dependencies - dev and runtime packages for all:
	taglib
	gstreamer-0.10
	ncurses
